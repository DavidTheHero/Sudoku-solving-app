# Sudoku Solver App

A powerful and efficient Sudoku solving application that uses advanced algorithms to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle.

## Features

- **Fast Solving Algorithm**: Implements backtracking algorithm with optimization techniques
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Solve puzzles ranging from easy to expert
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid Sudoku puzzle input before solving
- **Clean Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface
- **Solution Verification**: Validates that the solution follows all Sudoku rules

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd sudoku-solver

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
# npm install
# or
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the application
python sudoku_solver.py
# or
node index.js
```

### Input Format

The Sudoku puzzle should be provided as a 9x9 grid where:
- Numbers 1-9 represent filled cells
- 0 or . represents empty cells

Example:
```
5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9
```

## Algorithm

The solver uses a **backtracking algorithm** with the following optimizations:

1. **Constraint Propagation**: Reduces the search space by eliminating impossible values
2. **Most Constrained Variable**: Chooses cells with fewer possibilities first
3. **Forward Checking**: Detects conflicts early in the search process

## Examples

### Solving a Puzzle

```python
from sudoku_solver import SudokuSolver

puzzle = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    # ... rest of the puzzle
]

solver = SudokuSolver()
solution = solver.solve(puzzle)
solver.display(solution)
```
